# gene_expression_vs_ikzf1_main_documentation
A comparison of gene expression profiles of MD tumors with altered IKZF1 vs those with normal IKZF1 vs those from normal CD4+ cells

We know that IKZF1 is likely one of the main driver genes of MD Lymphomas. It is a tumor suppressor gene that is either mutated or has it's gene expression significantly repressed; either has been shown to contribute to certain human leukemias and lymphomas (e.g. B- and T-cell Acute lymphoblastic Leukemias (ALL)). We know that in these situations as well as in IKZF1 acts as a master regulator to influence the gene expression of many host genome genes as well as viral genes in certain curcumstances. In this analysis, we will distinguish groups between different forms of mutated IKZF1-containsing tumors, tumors with seemingly functioning IKZF1, and normal control uninfected cd4+ cells. We will also compare cohorts within the same sex as we know that the rna we extracted from MD Lymphomas has been contaminated with surrounding normal gonadal tissue. Once we have found differentially expressed genes, we will perform correlation analyses between them and normal IKZF1 transcript levels as well as mutated IKZF1 transcript levels. We will also perform similar against with the integrated viral genome.
